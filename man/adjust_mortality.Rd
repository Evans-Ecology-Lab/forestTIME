\title{Adjust interpolated tables for mortality}
\usage{
adjust_mortality(data_interpolated, use_mortyr = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_interpolated}{tibble created by \code{\link[=interpolate_data]{interpolate_data()}}}

\item{use_mortyr}{logical; use \code{MORTYR} (if recorded) as the first year a
tree was dead?}
}
\value{
a tibble with additional columns \code{MORTYR_eff}, which is \code{MORTYR} but
adjusted forward a year in the case when the tree was alive in the recorded
\code{MORTYR}, and \code{midpt_dead}, which is just the midpoint year (rounded down)
between the inventory year when a tree was last observed a live and the
inventory year it was first observed dead.
}
\description{
This is an "internal" functionâ€”most users will want to run \code{\link[=fia_annualize]{fia_annualize()}}
instead. Trees in the input \code{data_interpolated} already have had their switch
to \code{STATUSCD} 2 (i.e. death) interpolated to the midpoint (rounded down)
between it's last survey alive and first survey dead.
}
\details{
This does the following:
\itemize{
\item Optionally figures out if a tree has a recorded \code{MORTYR} and uses that for
the transition to \code{STATUSCD} 2 instead of the interpolated values. If the
tree is alive (\code{STATUSCD} 1) in \code{MORTYR}, then it is assumed it died in the
following year.
\item Adjusts \code{STANDING_DEAD_CD} so that it only applies to dead trees
\item Adjusts \code{DECAYCD} so that it only applies to standing dead trees
\item Adjusts \code{DIA}, \code{HT}, \code{ACTUALHT}, \code{CULL}, and \code{CR} so that they only apply
to live or standing dead trees in sampled conitions.
}
