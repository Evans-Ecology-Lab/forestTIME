\title{Read in and join all required tables}
\usage{
prep_data(db)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{a list of tables produced by \code{\link[=read_fia]{read_fia()}}}
}
\description{
Reads in all the tables needed for carbon estimation and population scaling
and joins them into a single table.  Also creates unique tree an plot
identifiers (\code{tree_ID} and \code{plot_ID}, respectively).  Removes "problem" trees
such as those with only records when they are dead and trees that switch
species (\code{SPCD}). Fills in missing values for \code{ACTUALHT} with values from
\code{HT} to prepare for interpolation.
