\title{Linear intrpolation and extrapolation}
\usage{
inter_extra_polate(x, y, extrapolate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric; an x variable, usually \code{YEAR} in \code{forestTIME}}

\item{y}{numeric; the variable to be interpolated/extrapolated}

\item{extrapolate}{logical; perform extrapolation if possible?}
}
\value{
numeric vector

a numeric vector
}
\description{
Performs linear interpolation and, optionally, extrapolation of numeric
vectors. In \code{forestTIME}, Interpolation is used for annualizing tree
measurements such as \code{DIA}, \code{HT}, and \code{ACTUALHT}. Extrapolation is necessary
for trees that are alive in one inventory, then fallen and dead with \code{NA}s in
the next inventory, because we want to extrapolate their growth from the last
time they were inventoried alive to an estimated mortality year. In the case
of vectors with only one non-NA value, that value is carried forward if
\code{extrapolate = TRUE}.

\examples{
x <- 1:7
y <- c(2, NA, 5, 6, NA, NA, NA)
inter_extra_polate(x = x, y = y)
#with extrapolation
inter_extra_polate(x = x, y = y, extrapolate = TRUE)
#single numbers get carried forward
y2 <- c(NA, NA, 3, NA, NA)
inter_extra_polate(x = x, y = y2, extrapolate = TRUE)
