\title{Linear intrpolation and extrapolation}
\usage{
inter_extra_polate(x, y, extrapolate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric; an x variable, usually \code{YEAR} in forestTIME-builder}

\item{y}{numeric; the variable to be interpolated/extrapolated}

\item{extrapolate}{logical; perform extrapolation if possible?}
}
\value{
numeric vector

a numeric vector
}
\description{
Performs linear interpolation and, optionally, extrapolation.  Interpolation
is used for annualizing tree measurements such as \code{DIA}, \code{HT}, and
\code{ACTUALHT}.  Extrapolation is necessary for trees that have \code{NA}s recorded in
their first inventory marked dead because we want to extrapolate their growth
from the last time they were inventoried alive to an estimated mortality
year.

\examples{
x <- 1:7
y <- c(2, NA, 5, 6, NA, NA, NA)
inter_extra_polate(x = x, y = y)
