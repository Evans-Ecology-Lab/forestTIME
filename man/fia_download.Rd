\title{Download zip files from FIA datamart}
\usage{
fia_download(states, download_dir = "fia", extract = TRUE, keep_zip = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{states}{vector of state abbreviations; for all states use \code{state.abb}.}

\item{download_dir}{where to save the zip files.}

\item{extract}{logical; extract the TREE and PLOT csv files?}

\item{keep_zip}{logical; keep the .zip file after CSVs are extracted?}
}
\value{
returns nothing
}
\description{
The zip files are smaller than just the *_TREE.csv, so this just downloads
the whole zip and extracts the required CSV files (TREE, PLOT, and COND). Uses
\code{curl::multi_download()} which resumes and skips partial and incomplete
downloads, respectively, when run subsequent times.
