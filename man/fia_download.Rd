\title{Download zip files from FIA datamart}
\usage{
fia_download(
  states,
  download_dir = "fia",
  extract = c("forestTIME", "rFIA", "all", "none"),
  keep_zip = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{states}{vector of state abbreviations; for all states use \code{state.abb}.}

\item{download_dir}{where to save the zip files.}

\item{extract}{which files to extract from the downloaded zip fileâ€”those
needed by \code{forestTIME.builder}, those needed by \code{rFIA} (which includes all
the tables \code{forestTIME.builder} needs), all the files, or none.}

\item{keep_zip}{logical; keep the .zip file after CSVs are extracted?
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
returns nothing
}
\description{
The zip files are smaller than just the *_TREE.csv, so this just downloads
the whole zip and extracts the required CSV files. Uses
\code{curl::multi_download()} which resumes and skips partial and incomplete
downloads, respectively, when run subsequent times.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# "Standard" download
fia_download(states = c("RI", "DE"))

# Extract enough tables so it works with rFIA::readFIA() also
fia_download(states = c("RI", "DE"), extract = "rFIA")
}
