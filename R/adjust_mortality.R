#' Adjust interpolated tables for mortality
#'
#' This is an "internal" functionâ€”most users will want to run [fia_annualize()]
#' instead. Trees in the input `data_interpolated` already have had their switch
#' to `STATUSCD` 2 (i.e. death) interpolated to the midpoint (rounded down)
#' between it's last survey alive and first survey dead.
#'
#' This does the following:
#' - Optionally figures out if a tree has a recorded `MORTYR` and uses that for
#'   the transition to `STATUSCD` 2 instead of the interpolated values. If the
#'   tree is alive (`STATUSCD` 1) in `MORTYR`, then it is assumed it died in the
#'   following year.
#' - Adjusts `STANDING_DEAD_CD` so that it only applies to dead trees
#' - Adjusts `DECAYCD` so that it only applies to standing dead trees
#' - Adjusts `DIA`, `HT`, `ACTUALHT`, `CULL`, and `CR` so that they only apply
#'   to live or standing dead trees in sampled conitions.
#'
#' @param data_interpolated tibble created by [interpolate_data()]
#' @param use_mortyr logical; use `MORTYR` (if recorded) as the first year a
#'   tree was dead?
#' @export
#' @keywords internal
#' @returns a tibble with additional columns `MORTYR_eff`, which is `MORTYR` but
#'   adjusted forward a year in the case when the tree was alive in the recorded
#'   `MORTYR`, and `midpt_dead`, which is just the midpoint year (rounded down)
#'   between the inventory year when a tree was last observed a live and the
#'   inventory year it was first observed dead.
